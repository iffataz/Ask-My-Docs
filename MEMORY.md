# Build Log

Running log of what shipped per phase. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the workflow and [ask-my-docs-brief.md](ask-my-docs-brief.md) for the spec.

## Setup — 2026-07-03

- Added `CLAUDE.md`, `ask-my-docs-brief.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- Workflow: plan mode per phase → user accepts → Sonnet executes → manual review (graph module always reviewed regardless of author) → update this file → commit.
- Next: Phase 1 — backend skeleton (config, ingestion, vector store, chunker tests).
